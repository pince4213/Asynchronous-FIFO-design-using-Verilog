# Asynchronous-FIFO-design-using-Verilog
This is a 16Ã—16 Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog. It allows safe data transfer between different clock domains using Gray code pointers and synchronizers. The FIFO handles full and empty conditions and supports independent read/write operations with reset control.
